# Stephan-s-Multiple-Choice-Quiz-Do-YOU-know-what-you-are-talking-about-

With creating this quiz, my goal was to create a quiz that tests basic JS knowledge that a programmer should know. With 5 questions, each having a score of 20 given to them for a correct answer, the score is set out of 100. After running into various challenges, I was able to find a method that worked. This quiz also stores user scores and can return the score using the user's name. I also had REPO issues, so that is why there are a limited amount of commites unfortunatley. I was not checking is my pushes actually pushed as I was creating the program
